**2. Remotely Connecting**
If you are using Windows, go to the website: [Link](https://gitforwindows.org/) to download and install the git. Follow the instruction on this link: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994) to set git bash as the default terminal in Visual Studio Code. (I skip this step because I use Mac)

Then, to connect to ssh, open a new terminal in VScode (Ctrl or Command + `, or use the Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option). Then type ssh followed by a space and your course specific account. It should look like this: 
```
$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
but with different account.
